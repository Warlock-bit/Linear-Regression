# Linear-Regression
Admission Prediction with Linear Regression using statsmodel (Interpreting the Summary table and verifying assumptions of Linear Regression)

# What am I predicting?
Using This model we are suppose to predict whether a student will get chance of admission(target) in university given it's GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, Research, SOP and LOR (features).
Since target is continuous in nature we are using regression specially Linear Regression.
